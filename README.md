# Mi casa
Welcome to Mi Casa. A floor plan made entirely by html and css

https://alexander-svendsen.github.io/mi-casa

## Setup

Its a single html file `public/index.html` and multiple sass files the `src/` folder. `mains.scss` is the file you need to build to css to get something you can link into the `index.html`.

This project uses `npm` and the `parcel-bundler` to build the sass and add the built css file into the `index.html`.

To run the project use:

```sh
npm install
npm start
```
